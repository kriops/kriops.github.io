I build strong, secure software solutions using Java and Spring Boot for both big corporations and mid-sized businesses. Every week, millions rely on my past work for safe access. While I'm passionate about security, I'm also well-versed in general web application development. Beyond technical skills, I dive into the business side, focusing on strategy and growth. This double expertise ensures my software is not only robust and secure but also aligned with broader organizational goals.
